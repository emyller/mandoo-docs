A brief presentation
====================

Mandoo is a JavaScript library based on the philosphies that make your work really easier and cleaner.

Featuring a very flexible **DOM API** (with CSS3 selectors), **Ajax** tools, controlable **animations** (with easings), **custom events** support and a unique **module system**. Not enough? It's very easy to extend it by using - or even building - a plug-in.

Developed in a production environment, it's ready to face many of the common JavaScript tasks. It also lets your code be reused wherever you need it (the DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - principle).

Basic ideal
===========

It was designed to provide an easy, understandable way to make improvements to the user experience of your web page - or application. It's very important to notice, though, that :ref:`it doesn't help you to do things the messy way <philosophies-therightway>`: It won't help you to use things like inline events or load whole web pages with Ajax.

Just like good server-side frameworks (like Django) separates web development in three layers (models, controller and views), the client-side development is also separated by three layers: contents, styles and **behavior**. This last layer is where JavaScript fits in, and this is where Mandoo fits in too. This means that one of the Mandoo goals is help you to keep this organization, and these articles will guide you in this simple task.

If you didn't get what we meant above, don't worry. Just proceed.
